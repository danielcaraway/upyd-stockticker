### LOG:
12-05-06: 
* Had to use a different stock API (tiingo, not iex)
* Went back to "Part 3" and started StockTicker_Simple.py to troubleshoot strange graphing errors
* [This question had the fix](https://www.udemy.com/course/interactive-python-dashboards-with-plotly-and-dash/learn/lecture/10204672#questions/13318206)
